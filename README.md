# 🎮 Game Glitch Investigator: The Impossible Guesser

## 🚨 The Situation

You asked an AI to build a simple "Number Guessing Game" using Streamlit.
It wrote the code, ran away, and now the game is unplayable. 

- You can't win.
- The hints lie to you.
- The secret number seems to have commitment issues.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the broken app: `python -m streamlit run app.py`

## 🕵️‍♂️ Your Mission

1. **Play the game.** Open the "Developer Debug Info" tab in the app to see the secret number. Try to win.
2. **Find the State Bug.** Why does the secret number change every time you click "Submit"? Ask ChatGPT: *"How do I keep a variable from resetting in Streamlit when I click a button?"*
3. **Fix the Logic.** The hints ("Higher/Lower") are wrong. Fix them.
4. **Refactor & Test.** - Move the logic into `logic_utils.py`.
   - Run `pytest` in your terminal.
   - Keep fixing until all tests pass!

## 📝 Document Your Experience

- The game lets a user guess a randomly generated number within a given range. The range and number of attempts change based on the selected difficulty level. After each guess, the game gives a hint to guide the player. The game also calculates a score based on how well the player performs.

- Several issues were discovered during testing:

Incorrect hint direction (higher/lower messages were reversed).
Secret number comparison bug caused by inconsistent data types.
Input validation missing, allowing guesses outside the valid range.
Incorrect UI message showing the wrong guessing range.

- Fixes Applied

• Corrected comparison logic in check_guess()
• Ensured the secret number always remains an integer
• Added range validation in parse_guess()
• Refactored logic into logic_utils.py
• Updated UI text to display the correct range
• Verified functionality using pytest
